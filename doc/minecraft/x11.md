# Speedrunning on X11

- X11 is a more stable backend than Wayland, but is generally outdated compared to Wayland. We recommend you first try speedrunning on [Wayland](wayland.html), and switch to X11 if you face major problems.
- To get started on X11, setup [Ninjabrain Bot](x11/ninjabrain.html).
- For window resizing, setup [resetti](x11/resetti.html).
- After setting up resetti:
  - see [Boat Eye on X11](x11/boat-eye.html) to setup pixel perfect eye measuring (boat eye) both for new players and those who already had boat eye setup on Windows.
  - see [Keymap Rebinds on X11](x11/rebinding.html) for setting up rebinds for search crafting.
