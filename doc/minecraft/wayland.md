# Speedrunning on Wayland

- Wayland, as mentioned earlier, is newer and more up-to-date than X11. We recommend you first try speedrunning on Wayland, and switch to [X11](x11.html) if you face major problems.
- On Fedora KDE Plasma, Wayland is the default backend.
- Setup [waywall](./wayland/waywall.html) for Ninjabrain Bot support, window resizing, key remapping, magnifiers, and many other useful speedrunning utilities.
- After setting up waywall:
  - see [Boat Eye on Wayland](./wayland/boat-eye.html) to setup pixel perfect eye measuring (boat eye) both for new players and those who already had boat eye setup on Windows.
  - see [Keymap Rebinds using waywall](./wayland/rebinding.html) for setting up rebinds for search crafting.
