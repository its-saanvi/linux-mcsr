# Post Install

The following chapters will guide you through the post installation procedure of installing Linux for MCSR.

# Basic Terminal usage

- The primary method of downloading and installing software on Linux is using the package manager in the terminal. Open a terminal window with `Ctrl+Alt+T`, or you can open the start menu and search for **Konsole**.
- The terminal command for installing most things is `sudo dnf install`, followed by a list of apps or things you want to install.
- To update your system, and anything else you’ve installed with dnf, simply run `sudo dnf update`.
  - **Run this now** to ensure everything is up to date. It's a good idea to update things somewhat frequently.
- There are a couple other useful things dnf can do to help you with installing things, which you will learn to use with time.
- To learn more about the terminal, check out the [terminal](terminal.html) page.

# Software Manager

- The **Discover** app in Plasma is like an app store - it's a simple place for you to search and install packages and apps.
- Plasma will let you know when it finds any updates for apps you've installed through Discover.
