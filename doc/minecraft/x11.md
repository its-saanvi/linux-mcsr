# Speedrunning on X11

- X11 is a more stable backend than Wayland, but is generally outdated compared to Wayland. We recommend you first try speedrunning on [Wayland](wayland.html), and switch to X11 if you face major problems.

## Installing and running X11 on Fedora KDE Plasma

- On Fedora KDE Plasma, Wayland is the default backend. To switch to X11, run the below terminal command to install Plasma for X11, along with a few other helpful things:

```bash
sudo dnf install plasma-workspace-x11 xorg-x11-drivers setxkbmap xhost xmodmap xorg-x11-xauth xorg-x11-xinit xrdb
```

- Then, go to the start menu and **log out**.
- Look for a button in the bottom left corner of the sign-in screen - there, select **Plasma (X11)**, and log in as normal.

## Next steps

- To get started on X11, setup [Ninjabrain Bot](x11/ninjabrain.html).
- For window resizing, setup [resetti](x11/resetti.html).
  - After setting up resetti, see [Boat Eye on X11](x11/boat-eye.html) to setup pixel perfect eye measuring (boat eye) both for new players and those who already had boat eye setup on Windows.
- See [Keymap Rebinds on X11](x11/rebinding.html) for setting up rebinds for search crafting.
