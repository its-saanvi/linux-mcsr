# Linux MCSR

- A documentation repository to help setting up Linux for MCSR.

## Getting Started

- The instructions start from the very basics and explain each step verbosely. Feel free to skip some steps if you know what you are doing.
- You can get started right [here](index.html).
- If you have any issues, feel free to ask for help in the #public-help channel in the [Linux MCSR Discord server](https://discord.gg/3tm4UpUQ8t).
