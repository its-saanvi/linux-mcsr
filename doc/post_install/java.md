# Java

- Open up a terminal and type in these commands:
```bash
sudo dnf upgrade
sudo dnf install java-latest-openjdk
```
- This will install and setup the Java JDK for you.
- Remember! JDK versions will be named in the same format. So JDK 11 would be named as **java-11-openjdk** and so on. So if you want to install other versions of the JDK you follow the same format. Its easy, isn't it? :D
- If you want to install graalvm JDK, look [here](https://www.graalvm.org/downloads/). Make sure to select the latesst Java version along with `Linux x64` for the platform.
- After hitting the `Download` buttong you can unzip the zip that downloads by double clicking on it by opening `Files`.
- You can then add it to your launcher by pointing to the binary in `bin/java`.
