# Installation

The instructions given below will install Fedora on your PC.

## From Zero to Hero

- After testing out Fedora on the live environment, you are now ready to install it on your PC.
- In the Live Environment, click the **Install to Hard Drive** icon on the desktop.
- Run through the simple install steps. Make sure the correct disk is selected - if you shrunk your hard drive in Windows as shown in the [introduction](introduction.html) section, you should be able to move forward without any issues.
- Once the installer is complete, go to the start menu and restart your computer when you're ready.

## First Boot

- After rebooting, you should boot into your Fedora installation. If you're dual-booting, you'll get the option to pick either Fedora or Windows. Proceed with Fedora.
- Once booted, you can remove your USB. You will be prompted to **Start Setup** and set your username and password among other things.
- When prompted, you should enable third-party repositories during the setup. This will be required to install some software that might be proprietary but necessary for normal use.

Your Linux installation is now complete! We can now proceed with the [post-installation](post_install/post-install.html) steps.
